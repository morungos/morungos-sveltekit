## Baps (using a breadmaker)

This recipe makes 8 baps.

### Ingredients

* 300ml water
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 30g white vegetable shortening
* 500g white flour
* 1 1/2 tsp instant yeast

### Method

Put the water into the breadmaker tin, then add the salt and the sugar. Next add
the flour, and the chopped vegetable fat. Finally add the yeast. Use the "dough"
program to mix and run a rise, for 90 minutes.

When done, turn out the dough onto a floured countertop and shape roughly into a
sausage shape to make it easy to divide. Divide into 8, shape each into a
rounded flattened disc, and then lay out on a baking tin lined with parchment
paper, so they almost touch. Cover in cling film and allow to rise in a warm
place for another 90 minutes or so (I use an oven with the light on).

Close to the end of the second rise, pre-heat the oven to 450°F. Remove the
cling film, dust the tops of the rolls with a little flour, and bake for 10-15
minutes, until golden brown on top.

When done, lift the parchment paper onto a cooling rack, and gently separate at
15 minutes,

## Butteries

Butteries, or rowies, or even "morning rolls", are a traditional Aberdeenshire
roll, generally salty and fatty. They were common for the trawler
workers, because they were more immune to sea air.

They are particularly good warmed up and served for breakfast
with butter and marmalade.

This recipe makes 24 butteries.

### Ingredients

* 1½ lbs (700g) flour
* 8 oz (250g) lard or white fat
* 8 oz (250g) butter
* Salt: 1 level tablespoon plus 1 level teaspoon
* Caster sugar: 1 level tablespoon plus 1 level teaspoon
* 1 level tablespoon of dried yeast
* ½ pt of tepid water

### Method

Bake at gas mark 6-7, 425˚F, for 15 mins.
